FD-Association - Static bilingual website (FR/EN)
This project contains a professional static website for 'FD Association' (Kenge, Kwango), with pages:
- index.html, activites.html, services.html, apropos.html, contact.html
- style.css, script.js
- assets/images/ (logo, carousel and activity placeholders)

To publish:
1. Push the folder to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages (branch: main or gh-pages).
2. Or drop the files to Netlify/Vercel for instant deploy.

This build is static — forms are non-functional. Replace example contact details and sitemap URLs with real ones.
